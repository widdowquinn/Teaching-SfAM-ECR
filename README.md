## Run Workshop in the Cloud on MyBinder

MyBinder is a cloud-based service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks on someone else's hardware. This course is provided as interactive notebooks *via* this service, and you can start up an instance by clicking on the button below:

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/widdowquinn/teaching-sfam-ecr)

This approach has the advantage that it requires no further configuration: all materials and tools are pre-installed, and ready to go.

## Run Workshop on Your Own Machine

Setting up the course materials to run on your own machine involves following stages, which will be described one-by-one below:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure the bioinformatics package prerequisites are installed
3. Create a virtual environment for the Jupyter notebooks

To install and run these materials locally, you will require:

* The Anaconda Python distribution [[download]](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

### Download the materials

The materials are available for download at the link below:

* LINK

Download the compressed (`.zip`) file to a suitable location and unpack it. This will place the materials in a subdirectory called `Teaching-SfAM-ECR`. 

### Run the materials
