    "Modern biology is increasingly quantitative. Next-generation sequencing data is increasingly important and ubiquitous. Large-scale sampling and image acquisition are more frequent drivers of experimental understanding of systems. A greater proportion of practical biology - and especially computational biology - now involves managing, integrating and, above all, *understanding* larger datasets than have previously been available to biologists.\n",
